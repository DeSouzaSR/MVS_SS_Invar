# MVS SS Invar

## Simulating the Solar System in the invariant plane using the MVS integrator

By Sandro Ricardo DeSouza

This project aims to simulate and analyze the evolution of the solar system, almost flat and circularized, for a period of 10 Ma.

The MVS integrator of the Swift (<https://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/swift.html>) package was used.
